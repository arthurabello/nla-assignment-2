= Problem 1: Traditional Least Squares ( a - f )

== Linear Regression (a)

We have a set of equally spaced points $S := {t_i = i/m}, i = 0, 1, dots, m$, we will find the best _line_ $f(t) = alpha + beta t$ that approximates the points $(t_i, b_i) in RR^2$

The system of equations to be solved is to be given as a function of $t_i, b_i, m$.

#text(weight: "bold")[Solution:]

Approximating 2 points in $RR^2$ by a line is trivial, now approximating more than 2 points is a task that requires linear algebra. To see this, we will analyze the following example to build intuition for the general case:

Given the points $(1, 1), (2, 2(, (3, 2) in RR^2$, we would like a _line_ $y = c + d t$ that best approximates these 3 points, in other words, since we know that the line does not pass through all of the 3 points, we would like to find the _closest_ line to the line that would pass throught the 3 points, so the system:

$
  f(1) = c + d = 1\
  f(2) = c + 2d = 2\
  f(3) = c + 3d = 2
$

Clearly has no solution, but
